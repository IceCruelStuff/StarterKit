# StarterKit
StarterKit is a plugin, which you can use to set the starting Items for each player in the config. This will result in the player getting these items in their inventory. You can easily change the items in the config yourself.

Item0:
 - id: 272 <- for the Items
 - damage: 0 <- the damage Level
 - count: 1 <- for the lot
